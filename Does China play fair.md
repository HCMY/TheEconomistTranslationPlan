#Does china play fair?
## Competition from china will only get fierce. That‘s call for coll heads and wise poliies

**if Donald Trump had slapped punitive tariffs on all Chinese exports to America, as he promised, he would have started a trade war. Fortunately, the president hesitated, partly because he wants China's help in thwarting North Korea's nuclear ambitions.**
>如果川普按照他当初所承诺的，对中国所有的的出口到美国的商品增加惩罚性关税的话，他可能会挑起一场贸易战争。幸运的是，总统犹豫了，多是因为他想要中国帮助抑制朝鲜的核野心。

 **But that is not the end of the story. Tensions over China's industrial might now threaten the architecture of the global economy. American's trade representative this week called China "unprecedented" threaten that cannot be tamed by existing trade rules. The European Union, worried by a spate of Chinese acquisitions, are drafting stricter rules on foreign investment. And, all the while, China's strategy for modernising its economy is adding further strain.**

> 不过事情还没有结束，围绕中国产业的紧张局势在现在也许会威胁到全球经济结构。美贸易代表于本周称中国这种“出乎意料”的威胁不能被现有的贸易规则所束缚。
> 出于一系列中国收购的担忧，欧盟起草了更严格的外资投资政策。并且，一如既往的，中国增强了其加速其经济现代化建设的措施

**At the heart of these tensions one simple, overwhelming fact: firms around the world feel ever more competition from their Chinese rivals. China is not the first to industrialise, but none has ever [made the leap]()so rapidly and on such a monumental scale. Little more than a decade ago, Chinese boomed towns churned out zips, socks and cigarette lighters. Today, the country is at the frontire of the new technology in everything from mobile payments to driverless cars.**
>在这些矛盾中，最简单也是最无可避免的一个因素就是：全球的公司都前所未有的面临来自中国对手的压力。中国并不是第一个工业化的国家，但从未有国家能在如此大的体量上做如此快速的飞跃。仅仅在10年前，中国的繁荣城市还在不顾质量的粗制烂造拉链，袜子，还有打火机。今天，这个国家处于新科技的前沿，无论从移动支付再到无人汽车，到处都有她的身影。

**Even China's achievements inspires awe, there is growing concern that the world will be dominated by an economy that does not play fair. Businesses feel threatened. Governments have seen Brexit and the election of Mr. Trump, worrying about job losses and shrinking of technological leadership. Yet if the outcome is to be good, they must all think clearly about the real nature of China's challenge. **
>即使中国的进步令人惊叹，但是整个世界的经济将被一个不按规矩来的经济体所主导的担忧正在上升。商人们感到威胁，政府经历了脱欧和美国大选后，对失业率和在科技领域的领导力缩水担忧不已, 但万一结局是好的，他们必须认真思考中国的挑战的本质
